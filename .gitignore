# Phaser specific (if any generated during development)
# This section might need customization based on your specific Phaser setup
# For example, if Phaser generates cache files or temporary assets.
# Generally, Phaser itself doesn't generate many files that need ignoring
# beyond the standard build outputs.
# If you have a specific asset pipeline that generates files you don't commit, add them here.
